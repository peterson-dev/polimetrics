        <p class="tl f4 content projectmeth pa3" id="methpage"><strong class=b>Engagement = total_retweets + total_favorites</strong> on a single tweet. The engagement values is what we use to compute a weighted average. A <strong class=b>weighted average</strong> is a method of computing a kind of arithmetic mean of a set of numbers in which some elements of the set carry more importance (weight) than others.</p>
        <p class="tl f4 content projectmeth pa3" id="methpage">With this in mind, engagement helps us derive proportionality of a tweet's activity. Here we achieve two distinct evaluations: the <i>aggregate average</i>--computed by summing the product of each individual tweets sentiment and the engagement proportion--and the <i>actual daily average</i>--where the proportion accounts only for the engagement total for that day, irrespective of the engagement totals in days prior. </p>

            <p> We begin our process by collecting Tweets with Twitter's Standard search API. This allows us to specify, and therefore return Tweets about, each candidate. Results can be returned with various search parameters such as candidate's first and last name, last name, hastags, and mentions. Unfortunately the Standard search API does not return all Tweets that are about the searched candidate, instead the results are a sampling of random but relevant Tweets. Given that the relevance is at play we have assumed that results received are a truly random sampling

        <button class="collapsible f1 b tl">Data Cleaning</button>
        <div class="content f4">
            <p> As we collect Tweets, we use a regular expression to remove all parts that are not useful for calculating sentiment, i.e., links, emojis, and @ symbols. This step is essential to ensure that the evaluation of sentiment is not misguided by information that does not have explicit meaning.

        <div class="content f4 mt3">
            <p> <p>We then use <a class="black link hover-red dib pointer" href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/"><strong>TextBlob</strong></a>, a simple API for natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate the cleaned Tweets' sentiment. TextBlob uses two sentiment analysis implementations, PatternAnalyzer and NaiveBayesAnalyzer. The PatternAnalyzer is based on the <a class="black link hover-red dib pointer" href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern"> <strong>pattern</strong></a> library. While the NaiveBayesAnalyzer is an Natural Language Toolkit classifier trained on a corpus of movie reviews.</p>
            <p>TextBlob returns two values when performing sentiment anaylsis on a text, polarity and and subjectivity. Polarity is a float between -1 (most negative sentiment) and 1 (most positive sentiment).
            Polarity uses the wording of a text to determine whether it is positive or negative and returns a float between -1 and 1, with -1 being completely negative and 1 being completely positive. Subjectivity refers to how direct, and therfore how explicit, the text is, which also provides a metric for the accuracy of the polarity. The value returned is a float ranging from 0 (very objective) to 1 (very subjective).</p>
