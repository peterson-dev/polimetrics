    In a world of daily robocalls, constant stimulus, and infrequent trips to the mailbox, traditional avenues of collecting opinion poll data has yielded a declining response rate for the past decade. The result of the 2016 presidential election only raises further questions about the accuracy of opinion polling. Despite a growing body of hard questions, pollsters have not made a concerted effort to adjust their means of collecting and evaluating poll data.
    <br>
    <br>
    Growing reports from academic circles argue that analysis of social media data is a strong, and in many cases more accurate, predictor of real world outcomes such as the stock market, Brexit, and the 2016 presidential election. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Polmetrics aims to bring these academic insights to the general public by creating an opinion poll that uses the mood sentiment of Tweets.
